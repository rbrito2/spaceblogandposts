    I currently work on the Onboard Computer subsystem team for the Western University-Nunavut Artic College CubeSat.           
    Through the project we have designed and are going to build a miniture satellite.                                                                                
                                                                                                                      
    One of the tools I have recently used is a Nucleo F429ZI dev board to test the functionality of our flight software. 
    A dev board is good way to test a program that you create. It usually includes an microcontroller, an input/output   
    port and some interfaces for passing data to/from the board. 
  
    Using the dev board we can test how the flight software interfaces with other subsystems like the EPS on the cubesat
    as well as its sensors. We use the dev board to send test data and see how flight software responds. </p>
